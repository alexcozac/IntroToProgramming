# IntroToProgramming
 Small Year 1 curriculum projects developed for Introduction to Programming Module
The repository consists of a Connect6 GUI Game, Scientific Calculator, and a Word Counter.
Grade Received: A*

These projects by no means follow good coding practices however they are a clear showcase of my progress within my first year of development in a programming language (Java), which was my first experience without any prior software development experience.
